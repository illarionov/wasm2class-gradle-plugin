## [0.4.0] — 2025-06-19

Bump Chicory version to 1.4.1

This is a binary-incompatible change. Many task names, configurations, classes, and paths have been renamed.

The name of the declared module now corresponds to the name of the generated class, i.e., the "Module" suffix is no longer added automatically.

Configuration names changed:
* `chicoryAotCompiler` -> `chicoryCompiler`
* `chicoryAotCompilerRuntimeClasspath` -> `chicoryCompilerRuntimeClasspath`

Task names changed:
* `<target>CompileAotModuleWithJavac` -> `<target>CompileWasmModuleWithJavac`

The main build directory changed from <build>/generated-chicory-aot to `<build>/generated-chicory`

Added the ability to specify a list of function numbers to be executed using the interpreter.
